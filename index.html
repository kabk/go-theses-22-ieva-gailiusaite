            <P> Monday 23 May 2021 was a day-off in the Netherlands. Like most
                of the people studying and working white-collar jobs here, I was
                involuntarily awarded a day free of commuting, labor and small
                talks. Monday 23 of May was the <i> Tweede Pinksterdag</i>.
                So, it is Monday, 23rd of May, around 11 am and I am having a
                pancake breakfast with my family when my daughter, seven years
                old at the time, asks what is about to turn into a loaded question,
                <b> what are we celebrating? </b>
                <p>
                It's just a day off, we shrug with my partner, collectively load the
                dishwasher, and leave for an extended dog walk. The echo of her
                innocent yet critical question stays with me for the rest of the day
                while catching up on laundry and whatever Netflix series we were
                into at the time. The next day I go to the Royal Academy of Arts
                in the Hague and I ask around: Does anyone know why are we granted
                this legitimised time of procrastination?
                  <p>
                Amazing- the eloquence of silence…
                  <p>
                Worry not, I consulted the oracle of a search engine- here is the
                answer: Tweede Pinksterdag also known as Whit
                Monday or Pentecost Monday and Monday of the Holy Spirit, is
                the holiday celebrated the day after Pentecost. It is
                a moveable feast in the Christian liturgical calendar, determined by
                the date of Easter. Pentecost from Greek pentecostē means “50th
                day”, Therefore it is always honoured on the Sunday that falls on
                the 50th day of Easter. The origin of the name "Whit Sunday" is
                generally attributed to the white garments formerly worn by those
                newly baptized on this occasion. The former pagan "barbarians"
                were given free white shirts- a great luxury in pre-industrial
                timesafter briefly submerging themselves in holy water. Surely everybody
                likes a good instant gratification; if this preview of monotheistic
                perks does not convince one to believe in the fields of gold in the
                afterlife, nothing will.
                  <p>
                Before the advent of Christianity, the Netherlands were populated
                by Celtic tribes in the South, which adhered to Celtic polytheism,
                and Germanic tribes in the North, which adhered to Germanic
                paganism. After the Roman Empire occupied the southern
                Netherlands, Roman mythology became important here, as well as
                religions from the Middle East, and eventually Christianity. Up
                until recently the later was reigning unquestioned, dictating the
                rules and pace of life for followers and non- believers alike, in the
                Netherlands, most of Europe and where ever else the missions
                spreading true faith, diseases and death took it. <b> The conquerors
                have implied their order upon whoever they have vanquished and
                here we are in this moment in time, in our white collars, booking
                our vacation days around holidays of religion, barely 24% of us in
                The Netherlands are associating ourselves with, for the sake of
                societal order and planning. </b> A truly divine plan, soaked into our
                individual and communal lives so deeply, it seems like it is the only
                possible system of operation- Gregorian calendar. Western
                calendar.

                <P> Here, I would like to make a small interruption in the narrative.
                To position myself and to make myself visible as the heroines of
                cultural studies and other writers alike bell hooks have done. My
                name is Ieva Gailiusaite, I am a white student from Lithuania
                graduating from The Royal Academy of Arts the Hague in
                Holland I was brought up in a catholic environment yet (or
                therefore) I have always felt a certain fascination for ancient
                cultures and pagan practices. One of the main aims of my
                currently theoretical research is to contextualize the dictate of the
                Gregorian calendar over indigenous time keeping and ritual
                practices. I will draw out the historical and societal conditions
                which surrounded pivotal moments of development in our
                overarching “global” calendar. Moreover, I am especially invested
                in the cultural/ spiritual knowledge appropriation element in the
                Western time tracking tradition therefore I will fractionate the
                events within the calendar- compartmentalization, celebrations,
                public religious holidays and commemorations - to highlight the
                colonialist appropriative nature of such time tracking. My writing
                and research is featuring intellectual works of D.Graebber and
                D.Wengrow, T.J.Demos, H.Schmid, I.Calvino, G. Schuller and
                other critical thinkers, artists and designers. Equally in regards of
                influence to this work I would like to share a statement by Mane
                Tatulyan, a contemporary designer and writer whose
                humanitarian thinking was ever so inspirational to think outside
                the preexisting conditions: <b> To design means to reinvent oneself and, thus,
                the social body, becoming an active participant of its transformation. </b> It also
                means to understand that we can reconstruct the world, like our modern
                predecessors, and shape a new, organized and human-centered reality. <…>

                The conquerors, whether they are warlords or human satellites of
                the Lord himself, do not only write history, they as well get to set
                the pace for the present, and squeeze the future into their grid too.
                In any imperial/ colonialist practice, of religious kind especially,
                the conditioning of the new subjects is not up for a discussion.

                However, while this position is the one of power, annihilating
                cultures is a prosaic task. The villainous “architects” of the
                supposed Terra Incognitas, are required to cunningly replicate, not
                creatively concoct, the signs, the houses of worship, the candles, the
                somber incents of their predecessors for their “bettered” world to
                start to exist. <b> Whatever was impossible to achieve with an initial
                iron fist, must be altered through (un)subtle fabrication.</b> And even
                if the fabrication is very plain and legible to the contemporaries of
                this transformation, ultimately, the visions of indigenous worship,
                healing and their whole way of interacting with time and space is
                either assimilated, given a new name or forgotten altogether. The
                language (both verbal and non-verbal) is stripped of capacity of
                self-referencing and therefore the people who speak it are robbed
                of of auto-narration, self-guidance and governance. It is the better
                new ideas that are going to be used to come up with the future and
                brave new words make up the brave new narratives, new myths of
                creation and therefore the future direction.

                There is an illustrative fragment in the book Invisible Cities, by
                Italo Calvino. The whole novel in part is about memory and
                places, as real as they are conceptual. This idle little story is of the
                city of Zirma where everything is redundant, people and places
                vary very little, and always fit the same descriptions; after visiting
                this place, the memory of the travelers is reducing the seen into
                single items- one tattoo parlour, one girl with a trained puma, one
                obese woman suffering in the humidity of the train platform.
                Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city can begin to exist. ——— / <i> 5 / Calvino, Italo " Invisible cities ". Boston new york: Mariner books, 2021. Print. p19 </i> / ———

                Like many households in North Lithuania, ours too had a small
                wooden sauna built on the edge of the homestead. It was used
                every other Saturday; on remaining Saturdays we used the
                neighbor’s sauna. These buildings stood away from the houses and


                  <p>
                barns usually by the edges of the orchards and small grass
                meadows and, whenever possible, by the bodies of water. Our
                sauna was made of thick wooden poles, untreated by paint, the
                seams perfectly interlaced without any additional insulation. No
                nails, nor screws. Two tiny square windows, maybe 20cm wide.
                Straw roof, untreated wooden floorboards, one could see the

                underneath.  <p>

                The first room one enters through the lock-free door, was a skinny

                Cold Room with two benches and a big tub of fresh cold water and a
                drinking mug, implying it was safe for consumption. We mostly

                were believed to live in saunas8 just like this one. Theses Neolithic
                deities originally enjoyed dwelling by rocks, swamps, rivers, and
                lakes. Thus, saunas with massive hot stones and tubs of water and
                clouds of steam were their perfect habitats. They were
                anthropomorphic female beings who could, for instance, make one
                weave faster and straighter, multiply grains and hey, help one get
                pregnant, gift a poor girl with a never-ending roll of silk as long as
                she never measures it, cure the ill, sing soul soothing lullabies…
                they might as well rip men’s guts out, trick one into never finding
                way home or eat up unattended children if previously wronged.

                These superstitions made people treat Laumės with utmost respect:
                the saunas were only saunas on Saturdays, the rest of the time they
                were Laumės’ homes as much as they were their humble wooden
                temples. After cleaning themselves people would leave clean towels
                out, make sure there is still some warm water left for the deities to
                bathe with and a wide bowl to soak their long hair in, fresh water
                for them to drink after; they did not dare to shout, swear nor
                otherwise act offensively or in a threatening manner in these
                Saturday gatherings. (My grandpa was forbidden to bring beer into
                the sauna and smoke while heating the furnace up throughout the
                whole day!) Except maybe for winter saunas. In the winter it gets
                completely dark by late noon there. After the men, who spent a
                whole day bringing in the water and heating it, were done bathing,
                it was the ladies turn. The sauna was at its highest temperature at
                that point, and every woman of ‘full health’ would whisk each
                other with steamed birch brooms then run outside completely
                naked and roll in the snow and laugh and cackle and cuss and
                scream like the true Laumės, like they really could multiply any
                kindness tenfold or rip anyone’s guts out if wronged.

                One Saturday evening while bathing there with my grandmother I

                Empire for centuries before Christianity took over and changed the
                “reason for the season” for the upcoming centuries, all the way to
                now, when these lines are being laid down on a page. All work and
                business were suspended. Slaves were given temporary freedom to say and do
                what they liked, and certain moral restrictions were eased. The streets were
                infected with a Mardi Gras madness; a mock king was chosen (Saturnalicius
                princeps); the seasonal greeting ‘io Saturnalia’ was heard everywhere.——— / <i> 10 / “Saturnalia.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.,

                early days of this tradition it was most likely celebrated on
                December 17 and eventually turned into a seven-day festival of
                elevated spirits, dances around evergreen trees, gifts to children
                and the poor and disregard of social norms, to the point of slaves
                being served by their masters with elaborate dinners and… a right

                Such strong, even if rare, experiences create a cohesive imprint in
                the public memory. With the transition to Christian way of
                conducting public life, the traditions of this magnitude could not
                have been left unattended and expected to just die off. They were
                too important and attempts of making people to part with it most
                likely would have created more troubles than gains. Therefore, like
                many other Christian festivals and rituals, Saturnalia had to
                experience a metamorphosis into... well, something more
                appropriate to the new monotheistic religion of the agricultural

                spark of political self-consciousness alive. They allowed people to imagine that
                other arrangements are feasible, even for society as a hole, since it was always

                attractive feature of the new religion, trying to attract the masses. It
                implies the previously scares moments of retaliation to be integral
                part of everyday practice. The reprisal is not less than canonic. At

                Either of the preceding celebrations have seasonality in common:
                winter sowing season (which varies in Southern Europe from
                October to January) and undeniably the winter solstice. In addition
                to the historical material pointing out that there was no census
                performed in the winter around the time Jesus Christ, was
                supposedly born, the theory of convenient rebrand is not simply

                <P>In a pursuit of a better calendar, we may turn ourselves towards
                the old days. What values and schemes were they based on? How
                did it work?
                <p>
                There is an abundance of ancient calendars from all over the globe
                going thousands of years back. They must have been products of
                generations-long observations, knowledge, and dedication. Due to
                the differences in world vision, communal values, natural
                differences in climate and geographical coordinates, and the stages
                of civilization development in which they were constructed, these
                systems vary in details and complexity yet always have a deep
                sensibility within themselves.
                  <p>
                One of the most famous and complex examples would be the
                Mayan calendar which in fact consists of three separate corresponding
                calendars: the Long Count, the Tzolkin (divine calendar), and the Haab (civil
                calendar). Each of them is cyclical, meaning that a certain number of days must
                occur before a new cycle can begin. The three calendars are used
                simultaneously. ——— / <i> 19 / Bikos, Konstantin. “The Mayan Calendar.” Timeanddate.com,

                I find it refreshing to observe that centuries ago the civil life could
                have been seen as disjoined affair from the spiritual life. And the
                calendar we have now? <b>It is not a universal default rule, but

                Efforts to implement this separation model sounds like Sisyphean
                task but it is up to the contemporaries to try to execute it. By refusing
                to enter the conspiracy, one remains innocent of than conspiracy. But to remain
                innocent may also be to remain ignorant. ——— / <i> 20 / Berger, John. “1.” Ways of Seeing, British Broadcasting Corporation and Penguin Books,

                In pagan Baltic Sea region tribes used ethnic calendar which was a
                collage of Lunar and phenological events. The starting point of the
                year most likely was the beginning of the deer and elk mating
                season (September/ October) after which the buck's antlers begin
                to shed to re-grow bigger antlers. From this moment forwards
                people would start counting New Moons. Counting from there, the
                end of third moon cycle coincides with the winter solstice, next
                three end with the signs of spring; three New Moons after that is the
                summer solstice before which the last little deer cubs are born. The
                3 - 6 - 9 algorithm emerges from such calendar. It is also preserved
                in archaeological remains of jewelry and intangible heritage, e.g.
                Christmas songs about a deer with nine antlers, burial geometry
                traditions of positioning the remains according to the position of
                celestial objects, practices of harvesting medicinal herbs and
                structuring other activities of sowing and reaping.
                <p>The Baltic
                Pagan calendar overall was significantly related to the specific
                phenological characteristics of the area: the variations in climate,
                biological cycles, migration of different fauna and seasonality of
                certain flora. <b>The harsher the climate, the more dependent people
                used to be on carefully considering all the cyclical factors as an
                insurance policy and treaty with the surrounding ecosystem.</b>

                  Coming back “home” to the Ancient Rome (and leaving the
                intricate Mayan calendar to only be remembered and appreciated
                for its impeccable accuracy on the next doomsday craze and the

                logic behind calendars before the centuries long reign of the
                Gregorian one.
                <p>
                Before the Georgian calendar the Roman Republic used Julian
                calendar which, even if long lived (45 BCE- 1582AD ——— / <i> 22 / Schuller, Gerlinde. Designing Universal Knowledge, Lars Müller, Baden, 2008, p. 26. / ———  </i>, -1900 in
                some orthodox countries, nowadays Orthodox Church in Russia),
                was very flawed from the get-go. Eventually the Julian calendar
                and important religious holidays, were several days out of sync with
                the fixed dates for astronomical events.<p>
                The introduction of the Gregorian calendar allowed for the  realignment with events like the Vernal equinox and Winter
                solstice. ——— / <i> 23 / Hocken, Vigdis. “The Julian Calendar.” Timeanddate.com,

                Why was this faulty system instigated in the first place?<p>
                The former Roman calendar was a very complicated lunar calendar,
                based on the moon phases, requiring a group of people to decide when days
                should be added or removed in order to keep the calendar in sync with the
                astronomical seasons, marked by equinoxes and solstices.

                the time it takes the Moon to pass through all of the Moon phases,

                until the next New Moon. ——— / <i> 25 / Hocken, Vigdis. “The Lunar Month.” Timeanddate.com,
                https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/lunar-month.html. / ———  </i> A lunar month is about 29.5 days. Back in
                Roman times there were only 10 months, hence September,
                October November and December were accordingly seventh,
                eighth, ninth and tenth months; the whole year only lasted 304
                days (the current months September, October, November,
                and December are still named after their original place in the
                “Republican calendar”). The remaining 61 days were just “winter”
                until eventually January and February were added to the beginning
                of the year. I presume, many can sympathize with just calling it “winter”
                though, the 61 days of waiting, reminiscing on the mysterium of the past rites in
                the cold serenity of an elevator music.<p>
                Besides all the possible variations of calendars yet when we think
                calendar, it is most likely a square table with numbers that enters the
                eyes mind. <b> Tidy pages with series of rows and columns, clusters of
                blocks, tables with matrixes on the screen.</b> Seven days in one line,
                on top of each other- weeks piled into spreads of months and
                booklets of years. So simple, available in any color, shape, style,
                typeface, paper and formatting. So universal and so omnipresent,
                like it was always there, helping us navigate, reach our goals, plan
                our work and play time, telling us when to rest and when to
                preserve our energy and grind because it’s only September and
                there is no time for recess until, well, same old Christmas. It was
                already there before us, we tend to shrug, like the air pollution or
                pesticides in our drinking water; unlike any other rule and
                legislation, which is a subject to change, calendar just does not
                need to change. Seems like it does not even have the capacity to

                Our system of time mapping is reigning unquestioned, designed to
                represent the interests and wisdoms of the ruling pontifex maximus,
                whoever or whatever they may be. And even to the groups of
                people, (in big part, one’s working in the creative industry) who do not
                see themselves as being in position of political power per se, <b> the

                With this elegant greater “we” awareness, why not dive into the
                unknown of time, time unaccounted for yet. Into the Uchronia!
                Designer and educator Helga Schmid in her book Uchronia:
                Designing Time describes it as way of questioning, speculating on and
                designing new kinds of temporal systems that are more about being in tune than
                on time. <b> What if we change the rules? What if the system can be
                designed according to the peoples’ needs and not the systems’
                preferences?</b> A mesh instead of a grid, with networks- smaller
                groups, where elements are not constrained to straight lines but
                able to find connections, meanings and work/pray/play- flows of
                their own.<p>
                It is what it is, goes a popular within the Dutch saying yet might it
                be a perfect instance to question who this time grid is working for
                and maybe, contemplate on our ripeness for a new form. <b> What
                sources of light guides us anymore? Could our calendar be the
                mesh absorbing more meanings and connections and pulsating
                according to the need of those entangled? </b>  Could it accommodate
                more <i> dynamic </i> voices? Voices of the tired, of the hungry, of the
                overworked ones, the religious, the atheists, the single mothers, or
                parents of pets, the unemployed and the bored, the neurodivergent
                ones, the loners, the ones that are on their 10th self-help book who
                are still frantically trying to catch up to something, the ones who
                are drowning deeper and deeper in their own personal and
                collective time crisis….<p>
                Perpetuating old systems for the sake of bureaucratic ease or respect
                to local tradition is to perpetuate the idea that certain voices and
                people (entire groups, no, continents of them!) are legitimately
                excluded from the conversation and eventual decision making.
                Heck with it. Time and especially calendars were never exactly as
                we think of it right now, the change is possible as it has happened
                on so many occurrences in the past. Time is kneadable. We should
                craft it around us instead of constraining ourselves to the crusty
                debris of the past.
